# [AMP Start](https://ampstart.com/) âš¡

A collection of quick-start templates to build your AMP page quickly and easily.
AMP Start is built on top of [Basscss](http://basscss.com/) a low-level CSS toolkit.

## Workspace Setup

### Installation

1. Install the latest [NodeJS LTS version](https://nodejs.org).
2. Install `yarn` ([instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/))
3. In the repo directory, run `yarn` command to install the required npm packages.

## Supported browsers

In general we support the 2 latest versions of major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Opera. We support desktop, phone, tablet and the web view version of these respective browsers.

Beyond that, the core AMP library and builtin elements should aim for very wide browser support and we accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent.

In particular, we try to maintain "it might not be perfect but isn't broken" - support for the Android 4.0 system browser and Chrome 28+ on phones.
